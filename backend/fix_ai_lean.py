# This shows what we need to update in ai_analyzer.py
# The AI is outputting: "Lean: Green Bay Packers +Spread (exact line TBD)"
# We want it to output: "Packers -2.5" or "Packers +3"

# Update the prompt in ai_analyzer.py to say:
# AI_LEAN:
# [Just state your pick clearly, e.g. "Lions -9.5" or "Under 47.5"]
